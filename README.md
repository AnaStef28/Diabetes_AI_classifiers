# Java & JavaFX Machine Learning Classifiers

This project is a simple Java and JavaFX application that implements and visualizes three machine learning classifiers:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Perceptron**
- **Naive Bayes**

## Features
- Load datasets for classification
- Train and test classifiers
- Ui made using JavaFX

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core logic and algorithms)
- **JavaFX** (User Interface)
- **Maven**

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Load a dataset (CSV format recommended).
3. Choose a classifier (KNN, Perceptron, or Naive Bayes).
4. Train the classifier and view accuracy results.


## Classifier Details
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Classifies based on the majority class of k nearest data points.
- **Perceptron**: A simple neural network model that learns a decision boundary.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
